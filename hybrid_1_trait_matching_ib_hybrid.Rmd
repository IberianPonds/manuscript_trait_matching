title: "Trait-matching model"
---

## Description:
This script uses one independent dataset (Brose et al. 2019) to infer food web interactions in Iberian Ponds hybrid dataset (morphological+ edna) (Pereira et al.2021), by applying trait matching (adapted from Laigle et al. 2018).


```{r include = FALSE}
# load packages
library(randomForest)
library(plyr)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# load independent data:  Brose et al 2019
load(file = "./data/hybrid_interact_con_res_ib.RData")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# remove links with missing biomass
hybrid_interact_con_res_ib <- 
  hybrid_interact_con_res_ib %>% drop_na(.)
```

# Building randomforest models for IPN Hybrid
```{r}
# run random forest 
hybrid_rf_mod_ib <- randomForest(value ~ ., data = hybrid_interact_con_res_ib, importance=TRUE)

# save objects
#save(hybrid_rf_mod_ib, file = "./output/hybrid_rf_mod_ib.RData")
```
